# SudokuSolver

<h1> Background </h1>
I thought of this problem when my dad was complaining about a particularly tough sudoku in the daily newspaper. I first thought of developing my own strategy for solving sudokus however after doing some research I later decided to implement a backtracking algorithm commonly used to solve these types of problems.


<h1>Instructions</h1>
 
This implementation of the backtracking algorithm requires a graph to be in the form of a table of values as shown:

5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0 <br>
6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0 <br>
0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0 <br>
8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3 <br>
4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1 <br>
7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6 <br>
0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0 <br>
0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5 <br>
0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9 <br>
  
  
Where 0 is a non given value within the sudoku to be solved.

The graph you wish to used must be assigned to a variable and the 'Main' class must be instantiated with it as a parameter. The program will then give you three lives to solve the sudoku before the program closes. 



<h1>Possible additions </h1>
1. Adittions and tidied up GUI
2. Allow user to input any sudoku via given GUI
3. Options menu with different options for the user.

<h1> Major Lessons Learnt</h1>
1.	The more documentation the better.
a.	 During this task I took a break for Christmas and the hectic start to the second year of my university course, when I finally returned, I did not leave enough detail in the documentation for me to understand without taking time to remind myself.
2.	Use a more 'friendly' GUI framework.
a.	I found using java's GUI framework rather clunky and hard to work with. This caused my motivation to diminish when creating the GUI as it was not a challenge it was just a nuisance. 
    
3.	Planning with larger projects is key.
a.	Once completing this project and looking through the code I found I could think of different, perhaps more efficient ways of completing the same tasks. If I had done some minor planning ahead of time, I feel as though I would have been able to put these different ways into practice.
